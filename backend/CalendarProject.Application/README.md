# Application Layer

## What is the Application Layer?

The Application Layer is like a helpful manager in our calendar app. It takes requests from the users (through the API) and makes sure the right work gets done.

## What Does It Do?

1. **Takes Orders**: When someone wants to do something (like create a company or add an event), the Application layer listens to their request.

2. **Follows Rules**: It makes sure everyone follows the rules. For example, only company owners can add new employees.

3. **Talks to Everyone**: It talks to the database to save or get information, and then sends back what the user asked for.

4. **Sends Updates**: When something changes (like a new event is added), it tells everyone who needs to know right away using WebSockets.

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Company

Imagine you're playing with building blocks:

1. You say "I want to build a red house"
2. The Application layer checks:
   - Do you have permission to build houses? ✓
   - Is there already a house with this name? ✗
3. It creates the house and puts it on the table
4. It tells everyone "Look! A new red house!"

### Example 2: Adding a Calendar Event

Like planning a birthday party:

1. You say "I want to have a party on Saturday"
2. The Application layer checks:
   - Are you allowed to plan parties? ✓
   - Is Saturday free? ✓ 
   - Did you provide all needed information (like time)? ✓
3. It writes the party on the calendar
4. It sends invitations to all your friends

### Example 3: Listing Employees

Like looking at pictures of your classmates:

1. You ask "Show me all the people in my company"
2. The Application layer:
   - Checks if you're allowed to see this information ✓
   - Gets all the pictures from the storage box
   - Arranges them nicely in a row
3. It hands you the arranged pictures

## Why is it Important?

The Application layer keeps everything organized and makes sure everyone plays by the rules. Without it, things would get very messy!

It's like having a helpful teacher who makes sure everyone knows what to do and helps them do it correctly.
